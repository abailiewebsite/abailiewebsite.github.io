            <br><h3>Learning Goals</h3>
            <p>In the first weeks of working at Manulife, I outlined three clear goals that I deemed were applicable to my role at Manulife, 
                along with some personal goals I had for myself. These goals consisted of both skills I wanted to learn and that I considered 
                would be beneficial to my future as a software developer. I wanted to strengthen my knowledge of all things web development. 
                Specifically, becoming proficient at developing with ReactJS, but also doing it correctly along the way. 
                This meant all the React components I created would have to be put through unit testing and pass
                with 100% code coverage.

                                Goal #1 - To become proficent in developing with the React environment.

                                <h4>Goal Description</h4>
                                <p>React is a powerful tool. It can be used to develop webistes, or both iOS and Android apps 
                                    without the need to write the same app twice. So I made it a goal of mine to learn.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                                <p>Study, research, and practice while putting in an honest work ethic.</p>

                                <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                                <p>I excel in using React and can be relied on by fellow co-workers to fufil my duties.</p>

                                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                <p>I did recieve a good amount of exposure to React, and made a consistent effort to learn it.
                                    I do know the basics and the syntax of the langauge. However, I do not consider myself fluent
                                    yet and will need to teach myself more. I was relied on to implement features in React by co-workers, who
                                    were happy with my work, so you could say this goal was successful.
                                </p>

                            Goal #2 - Become proficent in the use of JIRA, as it is a very common project management tool within the industry.

                            <h4>Goal Description</h4>
                            <p>JIRA is used almost everywhere no for project management, and I never had much exposure to it before. Seeing
                                that Manulife used it made sense for it to be a goal to become proficent with it.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                            <p>Use daily, ask questions when needed.</p>

                            <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                            <p>Can navigate and use the features of JIRA with ease and without aid from others.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>I now know the ins-and-outs of JIRA, and feel I am effective at using the tool.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to get more involved in this coop. So I decided to join a popular program called the Innovation Lab.
                                They give you a problem and you and your team have to come up with a solution to present.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                            <p>Sign up for Innovation Lab to gain experience and network with others.</p>

                            <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                            <p>Succesfully completed my involvement in Innovation Lab.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>I failed to complete this goal, and decided to leave the Innovation Lab. My decision was based on me growing bored 
                                of the tasks required in Innovation Lab, and felt there was no point if I did not give it my all. I prefered to take
                                that time missed at Innovation Lab and put it back into my work in the office.

            <br><h3>Job Description</h3>
            <p>During my time at Manulife, I held the position of Full Stack Software Engineer. This was my first full-stack role, which I was excited for. 
                The team I was placed with at Manulife was called the Capability Squad of the Individual Insurance Engineering Group. This team has been working
                on a project for the last 2 years to what is projected to be a 4-year project. In short, the project is to take the exisiting website that Manulife's 
                insurance advisors use to sign up clients, called Advisor Portal, and rebuild it with modern technologies while making much-needed improvements along the way. 
                My team decided to use React to build the new website and use NodeJS to develop the micro-services in our backend.<br><br>

                My typical day started with a skype conference call between all members of the Capability Squad at 9:15 AM, where we would talk about what we did the day before, what we
                had planned for today, and if we had anything blocking us from getting our work done, this was essentially our daily stand-up. Every two weeks we would have
                a skype conference call between all the teams where our manager would discuss company news, policy updates, and training for the full-time employees. In this call
                would be teams from Kitchener, Waterloo, and Toronto.<br><br>
                
                My work at Manulife varied greatly since I was full-stack. I started in the front-end, helping build simple web pages using HTML / CSS and the skills I picked up from
                my last co-op. I then moved into adding components into our React pages, while also writing unit tests using Jest before a merge request into our working branch could be approved.
                I then moved into the back-end, where I was tasked with creating Jenkins pipelines. These pipelines would be used to trigger a Sonarqube check of the code automatically whenever
                new code got pushed. These pipelines helped control the quality of our code. I eventually moved onto helping build our API. Building routes that would grab data from our database
                package it nicely, and send it to our front-end. This is where I got exposure to Swagger, which I found very nice to use.<br><br>

                There where a lot of learning curves during this co-op. I essentially had to learn everything I was working on as I have not done much of it before. However, I put in the 
                time and work and it has paid off. As I result, I have become a better developer because of it.<br><br>
